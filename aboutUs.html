                    <p class="quote">Good day! I'm Carl Jexter B. Bandal, 21 years old. Finished my high school 7 years
                        ago in Philippine International School Qatar - Ain Khalid and a current 4th year student of BS
                        Architecture. I am also working part time for two separate architectural firms to expand my
                        knowledge on the field, and possibly shorten the apprenticeship period that I must work for to
                        take the boards. Currently torn between aiming for masters in construction management or simply
                        take advantage of incoming degree in architecture to take civil engineering for only 2
                        years.</br></br>
                        I don't really dream for the moon, stars, nor the sun. I just want enough money to go beyond
                        merely sustaining my needs.</br></br>

                        an interest in it since I was a child. I grew up as an only child while studying to improve
                        myself. I am what I call average but I can by picking up as much knowledge as I can so I can use
                        it for the future. I only want/need it to get a good job and provide a decent income so me and
                        my family could live on. Studied senior high as a HUMSS student, but then decided to go for IT.</br></br>
